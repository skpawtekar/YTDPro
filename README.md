# YouTube Downloader Pro - Fast and Personalized Video Downloads

Developed a YouTube video downloader application using Flask as the web framework, incorporating FFmpeg for efficient video and audio stream merging, and PyTube library for seamless YouTube video retrieval. 
In this project, I got to learn about python for web development, web frameworks, routing, API integration and much more.
